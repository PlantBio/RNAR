# RNAR : A package to analyze and visualize Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptomics data
This package is created by four UMass Amherst graduate students; Ahmet Bakirbas (abakirbas@umass.edu), An Tran (ant@umass.edu), Kien Nguyen (kiennguyen@umass.edu) and Stavroula Fili (sfili@umass.edu)

### Description
This package is designed to clean, analyze and visualize transcriptome data for any given organism. In this notebook we are using a data that came from a plant species called Arabidopsis thaliana. This package includes several self-written functions, as well as functions from some well-known packages of R Universe. 

Finally, we would like to thank our instructor Dr. Leontine Alkema (https://people.umass.edu/lalkema/) for this course and her valuable feedback.
